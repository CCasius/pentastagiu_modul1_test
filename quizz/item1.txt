regression is when the application was updated, when a new functionality was added.. when a new update was made to the app and we test it again to see if it works like it was working before the update.
retesting is when we discovered a bug, we gave it back to the developer to fix it, he says the bug was fixed, and then we retest to see if it was fixed.

what is regression? What is retesting?
