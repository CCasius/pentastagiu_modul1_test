Please state what is black box testing? How about white box testing? You can also give an example.

Black box testing - when the tester does not have access to the code --> ex:when he is testing only the interface of a webpage without knowing how it was created.

White box testing - when the person testing has access to code (used mainly by developers to verify their code)
when the developer is testing his own code to see if it gives any errors.
